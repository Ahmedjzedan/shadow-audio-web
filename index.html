        <h3>Short Summary</h3>
        <p><strong>ShadowAudio</strong> is designed with privacy as its core principle. We do not upload your audio recordings to any server. All audio is processed and stored locally on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collection & usage</h2>
    <p><strong>Microphone Data:</strong> The app uses your device's microphone to record audio in a circular buffer. This recording happens continuously in the background if enabled.</p>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All recordings are saved directly to your device's internal storage. We do not have access to these files. They are never uploaded to our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Background Recording</h2>
    <p>To provide the "Shadow Rewind" features, the app records audio while running in the background. A persistent notification will always be displayed in your status bar while recording is active, ensuring you are always aware when the microphone is in use.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your audio data with third parties. Usage data (such as app crashes) may be collected anonymously by services like Sentry to help us improve the app stability.</p>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>The app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect data to provide personalized ads.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
